## Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹


Iâ€™m a U.S. Army Veteran who recently made a career transition from the behavioral health field to pursue my passion for data science and analytics. I recently graduated from the University of Houston in August 2024 with an M.S. in Statistics and Data Science. I created this space to showcase some of my projects, both as a way to document my technical journey and to serve as a proof of concept for my skills.
